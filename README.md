# ðŸš— Car Rental Management System (SQL Project)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is a **Car Rental Management System** designed using **Microsoft SQL Server**.  
It models the real-world operations of a car rental business â€” managing cars, customers, bookings, payments, and maintenance activities.  
The database is fully normalized and demonstrates relationships between multiple entities through an **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**.
